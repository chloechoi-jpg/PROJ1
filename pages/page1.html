    <h1>The Beginning</h1>
    <p class="note"></p>You fall asleep faster than expected. The moment your eyes close, the world tilts. You feel weightless, then grounded again—standing in a vast field of silver grass that sways without wind. A pale sky stretches endlessly above you, dotted with slow-moving clouds shaped like familiar faces. Somehow, you know this place is a dream.
In the distance, three landmarks call your attention: a glowing tower, a quiet lake, and a crooked forest path.</p>
